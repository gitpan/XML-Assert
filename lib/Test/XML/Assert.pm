=head1 NAME

Test::XML::Assert - Tests XPaths into an XML Document for correct values/matches

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::XML::Assert tests => 2;

 my $xml1 = "<foo xmlns="urn:message"><bar baz="buzz">text</bar></foo>";
 my $xml2 = "<f:foo xmlns:f="urn:message"><f:bar baz="buzz">text</f:bar></f:foo>";
 my $xml3 = "<foo><bar baz="buzz">text</bar></foo>";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to test if two XML documents are semantically the
same. This also holds true if different prefixes are being used for the xmlns,
or if there is a default xmlns in place.

It uses XML::Assert to do all of it's checking.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

In all of the following subroutines there are three common parameters.

C<$doc> is a XML::LibXML documentElement(), which may or may not use
namespaces.

C<$xmlns> is a hashref of key value pairs which provide the namespace prefix
and the namespace they map to. These namespace prefixes should be used in your
$xpath. An empty hashref or null may also be passed if the $doc doesn't use
namespaces.

C<$xpath> is a string which contains the path to the element(s) you'd like to
match against, whether this is for a count or a value match.

=over 4

=item is_xpath_count($doc, $xmlns, $xpath, $count, $name)

Test passes if there are $count nodes referenced by $xpath in the $doc.

C<$count> is the number of expected nodes which match the C<$xpath>.

=item does_xpath_value_match($doc, $xmlns, $xpath, $match, $name)

Test passes if and only if C<$xpath> matches one node in C<$doc> and that
node's value smart matches C<$match>.

C<$match> is the thing to match again. I say thing since it can be a string or
a regex. In fact, it can be anything the smart smart operator can match
against. See L<perlsyn> for more details.

=item do_xpath_values_match($doc, $xmlns, $xpath, $match, $name)

Test passes if C<$path> matches at least one node in C<$doc> and all nodes
matched smart matches against C<$match>.

Again, C<$match> can be a scalar, regex, arrayref or anything the smart match
operator can match on.

=item does_attr_value_match($doc, $xmlns, $xpath, $attr, $match, $name)

Test passes if and only if C<$xpath> matches one node in C<$doc>, that node has
an attr called C<$attr> and the value of that smart matches C<$match>.

=item do_attr_values_match($doc, $xmlns, $xpath, $match, $name)

Test passes if C<$xpath> matches at least one node in C<$doc>, those nodes all
have an attr called C<$attr> and those values smart matches C<$match>.
